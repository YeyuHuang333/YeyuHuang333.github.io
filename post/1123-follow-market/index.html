                <p>So, first of all, I would say the first market summary, or whatever it is called, might be only extracts from various newsletters and websites. Since this is only the start point where I try to look into interesting news that might have influences on the financial market or any trading ideas hidden behind news regularly and put them down systematically in my own words, this could be fairly childish for the first few times, at least. But I do hope this would push myself really follow the market and generate more trading insights from tons of new information every day.</p>
<h2 id="market">Market</h2>
<p><img src="https://YeyuHuang333.github.io/post-images/1606239322688.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Basically two reasons for the market's trend:</p>
<ol>
<li>Biden wins or say, the next president is elected and the uncertainty is gone.</li>
<li>Efficient vaccine is invented.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="election-related">Election related</h2>
<p>The quadrennial changing of the White House guard can quickly reshuffle business allegiances. Yesterday, GM CEO Mary Barra pulled her company's support for a Trump administration lawsuit against the state of California.</p>
<p>Barra is trying to buddy up to Biden, who's made supporting the electric vehicle industry a priority for his administration. GM has been going all-in on electric, and last week upped its planned investments in electric and autonomous vehicles to $27 billion over the next five years.</p>
<p>Now, Biden takes the presidency, as is known to all, the Democratic Party has a strong preference towards clean/new energy and does not support the development of petrochemical/traditional energy. So obviously, it would be a strategy if you go long in equities of electronic car companies or ETF or whatever positively correlated and go short traditional energies.</p>
<p>Since the stability of the society would be achieved once everything is settled down, there must be a stimulus to the market generally. This is also the reason why the market turns up these days.</p>
<h2 id="vaccine">Vaccine</h2>
<p>Stocks rose on Monday after AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford said their coronavirus vaccine was up to 90% effective, becoming the third inoculation this month that was revealed to be effective in trial data.</p>
<p>The vaccine was 62% effective when delivered as two full doses a month apart, and 90% effective as a half dose followed by a full dose.</p>
<h2 id="tech-apps-antitrust">Tech Apps: Antitrust</h2>
<h3 id="amazon">Amazon</h3>
<p>The EU launched a case against Amazon, arguing it uses internal data to compete unfairly with Marketplace vendors. The Commission takes issue with Amazon systematically relying on non-public business data of independent sellers who sell on its marketplace, to the benefit of Amazon's own retail business, which directly competes with those third party sellers.</p>
<p>Macro points: this is specific targeting of a narrow part of Amazon, not 'break them up' or 'regulate big tech', and it's not protectionism - the EU does this to European companies all the time.</p>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p>A group of 165 companies and industry bodies have called on EU antitrust enforcers to take a tougher line against Google, saying the U.S. tech giant unfairly favours its own services on its web searches.</p>
<p>The group includes U.S. and UK companies as well as peers in 21 EU countries. It sent a joint letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Thursday, saying Google was giving its own services, such as those for accommodation, travel and jobs, preferential placement in its search results and urging swift action to stop the practice.</p>
<h2 id="ant-ipo-cancellation">Ant IPO cancellation</h2>
<p>There are two stories building:</p>
<ol>
<li>A speech by Jack Ma attacking Chinese state financial regulators prompted him to be slapped down as a message</li>
<li>Speech was a reaction to an already-imminent intervention driven by concerns that Chinese consumer lending (especially on Ant) is getting out of hand and poses social and systemic risks.<br>
Or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>Link to the interesting essay: <a href="URL'https://www.techbuzzchina.com/newsletter/signup/extra-buzz-19-ant-group-the-biggest-ipo-that-wasnt?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=c35a78add8-AUTOMATION_Welcome_Message_1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4999ca107f-c35a78add8-71228877'">Ant IPO</a></p>
<p>There’s been a whole spate of issues when it comes to unregulated (or not well-regulated) lending businesses in China. Huabei takes place of the more regularized Credit cards in China. A great number of Chinese people see the issue to be more and more young people spending themselves into ever deeper debt and ruining their future. The huge amount of money lending through product of Huabei is very likely to bring unstability.</p>
